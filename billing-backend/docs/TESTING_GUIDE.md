# Testing Guide - Billing Backend

This guide provides instructions for running comprehensive tests of the billing backend with short renewal periods and **very small API limits** for real-time validation of usage tracking and service limits.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Start the test environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml up -d

# 2. Wait for services to start (about 2 minutes)
# Watch the logs to see when services are ready:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml logs -f

# 3. Run the automated test suite
./scripts/test-runner.sh

# 4. Clean up after testing
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml down -v
```

## Monitoring During Tests

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml logs -f subscription-service-test

# Usage tracking and Redis operations
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml logs -f subscription-worker-test
```

### Database Access for Usage Monitoring
```bash
# Connect to test database
docker exec -it billing-postgres-test psql -U billing_user -d billing_test_db

# View plan limits
SELECT 
    name,
    price,
    (features->'limits'->>'api_calls')::int as basic_calls,
    (features->'limits'->>'premium_api_calls')::int as premium_calls,
    (features->'limits'->>'enterprise_api_calls')::int as enterprise_calls
FROM plans ORDER BY price;

# View user usage
SELECT 
    u.email,
    uu.feature_name,
    uu.usage_count,
    uu.reset_at
FROM user_usage uu
JOIN users u ON u.id = uu.user_id
ORDER BY u.email, uu.feature_name;

# View subscription status
SELECT 
    u.email,
    s.status,
    p.name as plan_name,
    s.start_date,
    s.end_date
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN users u ON u.id = s.user_id
JOIN plans p ON p.id = s.plan_id
WHERE s.status IN ('active', 'trial')
ORDER BY s.created_at DESC;
```

### Redis Monitoring for Usage Tracking
```bash
# Connect to Redis
docker exec -it billing-redis-test redis-cli

# Check usage tracking keys
KEYS usage:*

# View specific user usage
HGETALL usage:1:api_calls
HGETALL usage:1:premium_api_calls  
HGETALL usage:1:enterprise_api_calls

# Check queue sizes
LLEN queue:payment_initiation
LLEN queue:trial_payment
```

## Expected Results

After running the complete test suite, you should see:
- âœ… **Trial Plan**: 5 basic API calls limit enforced
- âœ… **Basic Plan**: 10 basic + 5 premium calls, enterprise blocked
- âœ… **Pro Plan**: All service types available with correct limits
- âœ… **Usage Tracking**: Independent tracking per service type
- âœ… **Limit Enforcement**: Services blocked when limits exceeded
- âœ… **Plan Upgrades**: Immediate availability of new services
- âœ… **Plan Downgrades**: Immediate blocking of unavailable services
- âœ… **Race Conditions**: Atomic usage tracking without double-counting
- âœ… **Error Messages**: Clear errors for each limit type

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Usage tracking not working:**
```bash
# Check Redis connection
docker exec billing-redis-test redis-cli ping

# Verify usage service endpoints
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/usage -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"

# Check plan features
docker exec billing-postgres-test psql -U billing_user -d billing_test_db -c "SELECT name, features FROM plans;"
```

**Limits not enforced:**
```bash
# Check plan configuration
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/plans

# Verify subscription status
curl http://localhost:8001/v1/subscriptions/active -H "Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}"

# Check usage service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testing.yml logs subscription-service-test | grep usage
```

**Services not blocked properly:**
```bash
# Verify plan features
SELECT name, features->'features' as available_features FROM plans;

# Check subscription plan
SELECT p.name, p.features FROM subscriptions s JOIN plans p ON p.id = s.plan_id WHERE s.user_id = {USER_ID};
```

## Success Metrics

The usage tracking system is working correctly if:
- **Limit Enforcement**: âœ… All service types properly blocked when limits exceeded
- **Service Availability**: âœ… Service access matches plan features exactly
- **Independent Tracking**: âœ… Basic/premium/enterprise usage tracked separately
- **Atomic Operations**: âœ… No race conditions in concurrent requests
- **Real-time Updates**: âœ… Plan changes immediately affect service availability
- **Error Handling**: âœ… Clear, specific error messages for each limit scenario
- **Performance**: âœ… < 100ms response time for usage tracking operations

## Usage Testing Commands Reference

### Quick Limit Testing
```bash
# Set JWT_TOKEN from login response
export JWT_TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# Test trial limits (should work 5 times)
for i in {1..6}; do 
  echo "Call $i:"; 
  curl -s -w " [%{http_code}]\n" -X POST http://localhost:8001/v1/usage/use \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"feature_name": "api_calls", "delta": 1}' | jq -r '.success // "FAILED"'
done

# Check current usage
curl -s http://localhost:8001/v1/usage -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" | jq .
```

This enhanced testing setup allows you to validate all usage tracking, service limits, and plan-based feature access in just **5-15 minutes** instead of waiting for real usage patterns! ðŸš€
